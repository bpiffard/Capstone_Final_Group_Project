### Possible questions:
1. Which kinds of people can be classified together? And which is the most effective media type for this clusters with same demographic traits?
2. Which kinds of products can be classified together? And which is the best promotion for this product group?
3. Among all features, What are the top 5 reasons affect the store sales? store size, product type, costumer's property?
4. Which kind of promotion is most cost-effective on different food category?



## Schema:

### Filter country with USA
### Standarlization

###  Feature Extraction / Demension reduction
- PCA: principal component analysis, variable reduction KMeans
  - Sample Clusters 
  - Scree Plot 
  - Feature Vector 
  - Recast the data along PCs. 
 
  **Possible group factors:** 
  - 1.demographic:'marital_status', 'gender', 'total_children', 'education','occupation', 'houseowner'
  - 2.products:'gross_weight','net_weight', 'recyclable_package', 'low_fat', 'units_per_case',
  - 3.store size:'store_sqft', 'grocery_sqft','frozen_sqft', 'meat_sqft' 
  - 4.location:'store_city', 'store_state'
  - 5.sales:'store_sales(in millions)', 'store_cost(in millions)','unit_sales(in millions)'

- Random Forest Model: classification and feature importance
- Neural Network: classification
- Multiple Linear Regression: features-cost or features-store sales ---> predictions

# Chanllenges:
## 1st Segment: Explore the dataset
   1. How to group columns? 
      - ---> Discover relationships between columns.
          - ---> Creat heatmaps to check correlations
   2. How to use data to customize promotion or media for campaigns. 
      - ---> KMeans clustering 
          - ---> PCA: It had to be over 10 pcs to get acculmulated explain variance ratio to 80%. KMeans clustering does not show in 2d or 3d plots.
   3. How to predict cost or store sales of campaigns (or customer purchases)? 
      - ---> Multiple linear regression
          - ---> The accuracy of multiple linear regression model is extremely low. Cost is not predictable.
          - ---> Store sales can be predicted by store features.
          
## 2st Segment: Create a webpage library
   1. How to connect multiple html together?
      - ---> use `<a href=""></a>` and `<img src="">` to create absolute links and relative links. Relative links didn't work.
          - ---> Use "/" to let vs code to direct the file path.
   2. Some stylish difficulties. ?????????
   3. How to upload file folder to GitHub?  ????????????
      - ---> GitHub detected multiple html in the folder. They can not be easily uploaded to the repository.
      - ---> GitHub only show raw data of html file. Even with the help of previewing, files from static folders does not display. 
          - ---> Use S3 bucket to hold static webpages. https://geekylane.com/static-website-using-s3-bucket/
   4. How to make dynamic and interactive webpages?  ????????
      - --->D3.js, highcharts.com
          - ---> How to use these starter code???
          - ---> How to loop data to code more efficiently?
