Why we choose this data source and what we were expecting to get out it?

Cost Prediction sounded interested since we are looking for a data source related to accounting (profit, revenue, overhead, marketing cost, how to attract new customers to increase sales).  The description of this data source “Predict cost on Media campaigns in food Mart of USA” sounded very instated and had the characteristics we were looking for.
After reviewing the contents of the data source, here are some of the questions we wanted to answer by the data source:

-	How many stores there are?
-	In which cities and states these stores are? 
-	Do costumer demographics link to membership card tiers?
-	Is the cost of sales promotions linked to customers demographics?
-	What is media cost, by state, by store type, by food department?
-	Which are top media promotions, the top unit of sales?
-	What are the sales, by department, store, food category?
