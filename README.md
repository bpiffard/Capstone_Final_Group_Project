## ML Combined:
### In ML Combined there are 2 datasets:
- Customer data
- Store Data

***
### Customer Attributes
- **Can the cost of a sales promotion be predicted by customer demographic data?**
  - Modeled with Multiple Linear regression
    - Result: Low Accuracy
  - Modeled with Random Rorest Regression 
    - Regression evaluated by Root Means Square Error (RMSE)
    
- **Can total store sales be predicted by customer demographic data?**
  - Modeled with Multiple Linear regression
    - Result: Low Accuracy
    
- **Can a customer's member card category (normal, bronze, golden, etc) be predicted by their demographic data?**
  - Modeled with a deep neural network.
    
- **(Heatmap) What correlations exist between individual features in customer demographical data?**

### Store Attributes
- **Can total store sales be predicted by store attributes (store square feet, salad bar, coffe bar, etc.)?**

- **(Heatmap) What correlations exist between individual features in store demographical data?**
