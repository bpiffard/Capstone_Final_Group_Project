# Capstone_Final_Group_Project
## Overview

- This project collected a demographic information of customer data as well as store, product, and promotion data. SQL database was used to store and query the data. Raw data was divdided into multiple tables and integrated according to column properties. To discover customer segment distributions, the factors of media cost and store sales, Tableau public was used to analyze and visualize the results. On the other hand, random forest classification, deep learning, random forest regressor and multiple linear regression model were applied to explore the correlation between member card, occupation, cost, store sales and other features, and make predictions. Finally, a webpage library was built to summarize and display our team work.
- Having tested several models, RandomForest Classifier & RandomForest Regression proved  the best performers for our dataset
- We explored grouping & aggregating  variables in our ML models to positive effect
- KMeans was not viable. Our dataset refused to cluster

## Data Source

Why we choose this data source and what we were expecting to get out it?

Cost Prediction sounded interested since we are looking for a data source related to accounting (profit, revenue, overhead, marketing cost, how to attract new customers to increase sales).  The description of this data source “Predict cost on Media campaigns in food Mart of USA” sounded very instated and had the characteristics we were looking for.
After reviewing the contents of the data source, here are some of the questions we wanted to answer by the data source:

-	How many stores there are?
-	In which cities and states these stores are? 
-	Do costumer demographics link to membership card tiers?
-	Is the cost of sales promotions linked to customers demographics?
-	What is media cost, by state, by store type, by food department?
-	Which are top media promotions, the top unit of sales?
-	What are the sales, by department, store, food category?
