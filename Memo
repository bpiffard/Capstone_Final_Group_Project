[One Hot Enconding vs. Label Encoding](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/03/one-hot-encoding-vs-label-encoding-using-scikit-learn/)
- Label Encoding
  - each label is assigned a unique integer based on **alphabetical ordering**.
  - is a process of converting categories to numbers.
- One Hot Encoding 
  - simply creates **additional features** based on the number of unique values in the categorical feature. 
  - every unique value in the category will be added as a feature.
  - is the process of creating dummy variables.
  - Drawback: The Dummy Variable Trap leads to the problem known as multicollinearity. Multicollinearity is a serious issue in machine learning models like Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.

- We apply One-Hot Encoding when:
  - The categorical feature is not ordinal (like the countries above)
  - The number of categorical features is less so one-hot encoding can be effectively applied
- We apply Label Encoding when:
  - The categorical feature is ordinal (like Jr. kg, Sr. kg, Primary school, high school)
  - The number of categories is quite large as one-hot encoding can lead to high memory consumption

[OneHotEncoder vs. get_dummies](https://pythonsimplified.com/difference-between-onehotencoder-and-get_dummies/)
- The get_dummies canâ€™t handle the unknown category during the transformation natively. You have to apply some techniques to handle it. But it is not efficient. On the other hand, OneHotEncoder will natively handle unknown categories. All you need to do is set the parameter handle_unknown='ignore' to OneHotEncoder.
- If you want to put your machine learning model into production, Scikit-learn Pipeline will be very useful. But, get_dummies is not compatible with the Scikit-learn pipeline. It requires you to create your own transformer. On the other hand, OneHotEncoder is compatible with the Scikit-learn pipeline.

[StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler and RobustScaler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/standardscaler-minmaxscaler-and-robustscaler-techniques-ml/)[link2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51237635/difference-between-standard-scaler-and-minmaxscaler)

- MinMaxScaler
  -(feature_range = (0, 1)) will transform each value in the column proportionally within the range [0,1]. Use this as the first scaler choice to transform a feature, as it will preserve the shape of the dataset (no distortion).
- StandardScaler
  - will transform each value in the column to range about the mean 0 and standard deviation 1, ie, each value will be normalised by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation. Use StandardScaler if you know the data distribution is normal.
- RobustScaler
  - If there are outliers, use RobustScaler(). Alternatively you could remove the outliers and use either of the above 2 scalers (choice depends on whether data is normally distributed)
**Note**:  If scaler is used before train_test_split, data leakage will happen. Do use scaler after train_test_split
